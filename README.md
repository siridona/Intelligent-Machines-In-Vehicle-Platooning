# Intelligent-Machines-In-Vehicle-Platooning
This project investigates intelligent vehicle platooning through a Python-based simulation environment, moving away from initial work in SUMO. We implemented various routing protocols, including C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything), URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication), GRP (Group Routing Protocol), and GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing), to enable efficient communication within platoons. Using Python, we created graph visualizations to model and analyze platooning behavior, comparing the protocols' effects on network efficiency, reliability, and latency. This work highlights the potential of different communication strategies in enhancing platoon safety and operational efficiency.
